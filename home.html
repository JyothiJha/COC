  <h3>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h3>
  <p>
    Diet is one of the most important factors that affect human health and well-being. However, 
many people struggle to maintain a healthy and balanced diet due to various reasons, such as 
lack of time, knowledge, motivation, or resources. Moreover, different individuals have 
different dietary needs and preferences, depending on their age, gender, lifestyle, medical 
conditions, and goals. Therefore, there is a need for a system that can help people plan and 
manage their diets according to their specific situations and requirements.
<br> The system will allow users to create, modify, and track their personal diet plans 
based on their health goals. The system will also provide various features, such as calorie 
calculator for a day updated by the user and progress report. The system will use a relational 
database to store and retrieve information about foods, recipes, diet plans, and user profiles.

  <p>A dietary calorie is defined as the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius. We use the calories that we eat and drink for essential functions such as breathing and thinking, as well as day-to-day activities such as walking, talking, and eating.

    Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down food. The more calories you consume, the more energy it can provide to your body. However, when you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat, leading to weight gain.
    <br>
    The simple answer is to maintain a healthy weight and overall wellness. When we eat and drink more calories than we use, our bodies store the excess as body fat. If this continues over time, we may put on weight. Knowing the calorie content of food and drink and how much we have makes it easier to keep track of our daily intake.
    
    Counting calories can help you eat fewer calories and lose weight. One review found that weight loss programs that included calorie counting led to an average of around 7 lbs(3.3 kg) more weight loss than those that didn't.
